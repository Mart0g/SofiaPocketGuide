	  Never pee into Dyson Airblade
	  The best lettuce wraps
	  Staff doesn't know what's on their menu and the worst coffee I've had at a dunkin donuts
	  Staff isn't very friendly and seems put off when taking orders  Probably b\/c they are so busy  Really hoping it improves  Not great coffee either (prefer Stone Creek or Alterra if really want coffee)
	  Brand new store  Staff appeared confused but it was very busy 
	  Great ride  especially since they changed the seating   Now everyone has their own window  Much better 
	  don't hold your breath

	  Wish I could tell you how the food is here  They said it was over an hour wait for a table when the place was half full  If that's how they manage the front I'd hate to know how they manage the back 
	  They don't like kids in this place  More than half the tables were empty and they told us that it was an hour wait once they saw our carriage  Shady  One girl told us not to eat here  said it was bad
