        <p class="lead">SofiaPocketGuide is a project relying entirely on modern technologies and particularly on the progress made in the
         area of artificial intelligence and machine learning. By achieving natural language processing using different algorithms and taking
         advantage of the open-source data that services like Foursquare provide, the application allows the user to communicate with a chatbot
         that will be able to recommend a venue based entirely on the user's desires.</p>
